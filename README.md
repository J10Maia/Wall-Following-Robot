## Overview

The Wall Following Robot is an autonomous robotic system designed to follow walls or obstacles using ultrasonic sensors. This project showcases my skills in embedded systems, real-time processing, and robotics. The robot can navigate environments by detecting and maintaining a specific distance from walls, making it ideal for applications in confined or structured spaces.
